# Rental Car Web Application

In this project, I used a HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a rental can website. You can search for the client by there last & first name through .JSON file I provided. The "index.html" is the file you need to run the project.

After a client is selected, the client information will be displayed in a new form with all information e.g. last name, first name, address, state/prov, email address. The client can then choose to rent a vehicle based on the rental choices. Note: the client can rent from 1 to 30 days. Finally, after you submit the form, the total of the rental is calculated and the complete client and rental information will be displayed on the page.
